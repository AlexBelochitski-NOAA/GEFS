Library variables are defined in setlibs.rc.

To build codes one at a time:
  In sh-like shell:
     source setlibs.rc
  This adds the library variables to the current shell environment.
  Then proceed to each directory:
     make clean
     make

To build all codes:
  sh build.sh

To install all builds (creating exec dir if necessary):
  sh install.sh

Can use load_libs.rc in place of setlibs.rc when library modules are available.
