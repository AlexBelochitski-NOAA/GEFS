Model: Global Ensemble Forecast System Legacy (GEFS_legacy)

Release Notes: GEFS_legacy v10.6.0  - released to NCO on October 9th, 2020

This release is prepared as a downstream update of the operational implementation of gfs v16. The code is based on gefs_lagacy V10.5.1 with the following change:
Avoid gfs analysis files from gfs v16 (to be implemented in Q2 FY21), which are different from gfs v15 in the number of vertical layers (127 vs 64) and file format (netCDF vs nemsio, by using gefs (v12) 00h forecast files (nemsio format).
Accept gfs pgrb2 files from gfs v16 with changed path
Modest cleaning of unused lines in some scripts
Modest effort to update scripts to EE2 request
Updated jobs include:
gefs_init_separate, scripts are modified to take gefs 00 hour forecast files as input. 
jgefs_atmos_prdgen_gfs, changed the path of gfs pgrb2 files.

Updated or newly added modules include
None

Newly added source code 
sorc/global_chgres_nemsio.fd
This new utility is used to process gefs 00h forecast nemsio files

Updated script files include:
Jobs
JGEFS_INIT_SEPARATE
Added $COMINgefs pointing to gefs/prod
JGEFS_PRDGEN_GFS
Modified path of gfs/prod pgrb2 data
Replaced $COMIN with $COMINgfs following SPA request
Scripts
Exgefs_init_separate.sh.ecf
Modified input analysis file names, using $COMINgefs
Deleted unused sections dealing with non-nemsio input, and error messages are used. This is to reduce confusion.

JOB DEPENDENCIES & FLOW DIAGRAM
GEFS_legacy is dependent on the following upstream models for input files:
gfs, tcvital file gfs.tXXz.syndata.tcvitals.tm00
gefs.v12.1.0, 00h forecast files from gefs_forecast_0_16d_c00 job 
GEFS has no downstream dependent models (except for Water Center)
GEFS flowchart is the same as in the prod.
