Release Note:  GEFS v.11.0.0

v10.0.0 – released Feb 1, 2012
●	Implementation on CCS
v10.1.0 – released July 25, 2013
●	Modified model to run on WCOSS
v10.2.0 – released Jan 1, 2015   (The first version in EE structure, but contains only part of the package)

v11.0.0 – to be released  May/June  2015
●	Made scientific changes to (1) uniform the GEFS and GDAS ensembles, buy initializing the forecast ensemble members from EKF 06h forecast of previous cycle; (2) improve model related uncertainties by upgrading the STTP scheme and (3) use the updated version of the GFS model with Semi-Lagrangian integration.
●	Modified to use new version GFS model code gsm.v12.1.0, slightly different from gsm.v12.0.1.
●	Modified to use new version of ncep_post v5.1.1.
●	Modified to use ENKF model version of enkf.v2.0.1.
●	Added new model version ens_tracker.v1.1.0.
●	Enhancement of bug fix from Bugzilla
●	Output changes
o	Grib2 replacing grib1 in all post processing jobs.
o	Removing generation of grib1 files in pgrb2a, pgrb2b, pgrb2alr and pgrb2blr.
o	Added half degree  grid pgrb2 data directory pgrb2ap5, every 3 hours from 00 to 192 hours, and 6 hourly from 192 to 384 hours.
o	Added new products of tropical storm track forecast and genesis probability, as text files, of the GEFS ensemble system.
o	Added new products (or replace existing products) of tropical storm track forecast and genesis probability, as text files, for other global ensemble systems: FNMOC (fens), ECMWF (ecme) and CMC (cmce), in their corresponding directories.
