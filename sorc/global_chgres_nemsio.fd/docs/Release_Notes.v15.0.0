Release Notes 
-------------

Model: global_chgres.v15.0.0
Version: 15.0.0
Implementation date/time: To be determined.
Purpose: To initialize the spectral version of the GFS by converting GFS or FV3GFS data 
from one horizontal and/or vertical resolution to another. This a stand-alone version
of global_chgres separate from the version under the GFS vertical structure.  It is intended
to be used as a utility by any NCEP process that needs it.
Developed by: NCEP/EMC   george.gayno@noaa.gov
Runs on: The National Weather Service (NWS) Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing System (WCOSS)
Community software: None
Input:
  -GFS atmospheric restart files in sigio or nemsio format
  -FV3GFS atmospheric history files (gaussian) in nemsio format
  -GFS surface restart files in sfcio or nemsio format
  -GFS NSST restart files in nstio or nemsio format
  -FV3GFS surface/NSST history files (gaussian) in nemio format
Output: Same file types as input but at the target resolution.
Primary users: NAM, GEFS and any process outside the GFS.

Changes being made for this release: Option to read gaussian history files
from FV3GFS.  

Implementation information

Compute resources:
  - Program runs with threads.

  - Compiler:  Intel Fortran

Pre-implementation testing requirements:
  - Should be tested as part of Q2FY19 FV3GFS package.
  - Evaluators: same as those for Q2FY19 FV3GFS package.
  - May be implemented before Q2FY19 FV3GFS.

Implementation Instructions:
  - cd to appropriate directory
  - Checkout code from git:  
      git clone --recursive gerrit:NCEPLIBS-util_shared
      git checkout global_chgres.v15.0.0
  - Build global_chgres program:  $ build_chgres.sh
  - Populate the ./fix subdirectory.  These files are
    not stored in the git repository.  Copy them from
    util_shared.v1.0.7 on Phase 2:
      $ cd fix
      $ cp -r /nwprod2/util_shared.v1.0.7/global_chgres.v14.1.1/fix/fix_am .
