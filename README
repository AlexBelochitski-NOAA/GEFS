To set up on WCOSS:

cd to your base directory
/nw(envir)
(to run as production)
or
[your directory]/[4 character identifier]/nwdev
(to run as development)

Check out 
svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gefs/tags/gefs_10.1.0_wcoss_production
or the tag for a later update

NOTE:  the "control" subdirectory contains the scripts and files used to 
run this system as a development user.  It is not needed for production.

NOTE:  The "sms.prod.20110518" subdirectory contains SMS job scripts from 
CCS production.  These are available for reference.

Create the exec and util/exec subdirectories.

Make the executables in the subdirectories of sorc and util/sorc:

In util/sorc/gefs_trak_ave.fd
issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to util/exec

In sorc/gefs_global_fcst.fd
execute the script 
makefile_wcoss.sh

In other source directories, issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to the exec subdirectory

NOTE:  warning messages are normally given during the compilation of the
following codes:
ens_trak_ave, about misalignment, as on the CCS
gefs_global_forecast
gefs_ncep_post

NOTE:  the restart_copy job is not ready for production yet.  This job 
does not affect the products:  it is only included to facilitate mirroring 
of restart files from the production to the development machine.  We will
submit an update when this job is ready.

NOTE:  the CPQF job is not yet ready for production yet;  the codes are 
included but not the scripts


To run GEFS as prod or para, 


Create job cards for ecflow based on the files in the subdirectory job_cards

Set job dependencies corresponding to those used in GEFS on the CCS

Use the *.dev versions of the j-job scripts.  ccs versions are
included for reference if necessary.

When the j-jobs are renamed, the job cards will need to be edited to
point to them.

If the ex scripts are renamed, the j-jobs will need to be edited to
point to them.


GEFS can be started running by either of these methods:


1.  If sfcsig (at least the sf06 files) and tracks are available for
the previous cycle, start with the gefs_init_separate job.

In testing with com_canned, we copied these directories for 2012102100 
and started running GEFS with initialization for 2012102106 .


2.  If the initial conditions are available in /nwges and in the
init subdirectory for the current cycle, start with the gefs_gfs_prdgen
and gefs_forecast_high jobs.



To run GEFS as a development user, follow the directions as written for the 
CCS in README.CCS
