To run on WCOSS:

Create your directory
/nw(envir)
or
........../nw{envir}

cd to this directory

Check out 
svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gefs/branches/wcoss_production_initial
or the appropriate tag on this branch

create the exec and util/exec subdirectories

In the source direcctories:

in sorc/gefs_global_fcst.fd
execute the script 
makefile_wcoss.sh

in other source directories, issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to the exec subdirectory

in util/sorc/gefs_trak_ave.fd
issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to util/exec


NOTE:  warning messages are normally given during the compilation of the
following codes:
ens_trak_ave, about misalignment, as on the CCS
gefs_global_forecast
gefs_ncep_post

NOTE:  the restart_copy job is not ready for production yet.  This job 
does not affect the products:  it is only included to facilitate mirroring 
of restart files from the production to the development machine.  We will
submit an update when this job is ready.


To run as prod or para, 

create job cards for ecflow based on the files in the subdirectory job_cards

set job dependencies corresponding to those used in GEFS on the CCS

Use the *.dev versions of the j-job scripts.  ccs versions are
included for reference if necessary.

When the j-jobs are renamed, the job cards will need to be edited to
point to them.

If the ex scripts are renamed, the j-jobs will need to be edited to
point to them.

GEFS can be started running in either of these ways:

1.  If sfcsig (at least the sf06 files) and tracks are available for
the previous cycle, start with the gefs_init_separate job.

In testing with com_canned, we copied these directories for 2012102100 
and started running GEFS with initialization for 2012102106 .


2.  If the initial conditions are available in /nwges and in the
init subdirectory for the current cycle, start with the gefs_gfs_prdgen
and gefs_forecast_high jobs.



To run as a development user, follow the directions as written for the 
CCS in README.CCS
