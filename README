To run on WCOSS:

Create your directory
/nw(envir)
or
........../nw{envir}

cd to this directory

Check out 
svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gefs/branches/wcoss_production_initial
or the appropriate tag on this branch

create the exec and util/exec subdirectories

In the source direcctories:

in sorc/gefs_global_fcst.fd
execute the script 
makefile_wcoss.sh

in other source directories, issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to the exec subdirectory

in util/sorc/gefs_trak_ave.fd
issue the command
make -f makefile_wcoss
and mv the executable to util/exec

NOTE:  warning messages are normally given by 
ens_trak_ave, about misalignment, as on the CCS
gefs_global_forecast
gefs_ncep_post

To run as prod or para, 

create jobcards for ecflow based on the files in the subdirectory lsf.bjob

set job dependencies corresponding to those used in GEFS on the CCS

GEFS can be started running in either of these ways:

1.  If sfcsig (at least the sf06 files) and tracks are available for
the previous cycle, start with the gefs_init_separate job.

2.  If the initial conditions are available in /nwges and in the
init subdirectory for the current cycle, start with the gefs_gfs_prdgen
and gefs_forecast_high jobs.



To run as a development user, follow the directions 
as written for the CCS in readme.ccs
