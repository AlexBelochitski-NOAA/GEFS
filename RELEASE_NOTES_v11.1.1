v11.0.0 . to be released May/June 2015
. Made scientific changes to (1) unify the GEFS and GDAS ensembles, by initializing the forecast
ensemble members from ENKF 06h forecast of previous cycle; (2) improve model related
uncertainties by upgrading the STTP scheme and (3) use the updated version of the GFS model
with SemiLagrangian
integration.
