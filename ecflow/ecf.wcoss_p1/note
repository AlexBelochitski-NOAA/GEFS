/gpfs/tp1/nco/ops/nwprod/gefs_legacy.v10.4.1/ecf/

    gefs_legacy  (have the script for init job and gefs_prdgen_gfs)
    gefs_legacy00
    gefs_legacy06
    gefs_legacy12
    gefs_legacy18

    3. Suggestion for ecflow scripts: when you transition to phase3, it
    would be better if you can remove the cycles, and combine all the cycles
    for the same job into one same script, and use the %cyc variable like it
    does in the gefs ecflow scripts
    (/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/nwprod/gefs.v11.3.9/ecf/gefs)

1. production gefs:

/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/nwprod/gefs.v11.3.9

ecflow script is under ecf/gefs/ subdirectory.

2. production gefs_legacy:

/nwprod/gefs_legacy.v10.4.1

ecflow script is under ecf/ subdirectory.


Please feel free to come down for any questions when you work on the ecflow scripts for gefs_legacy.  I think the gefs_legacy may need one more variable in addition to %cyc% (for the cyc after "cf") , may call %subcyc% something like that, or whatever you prefer.
