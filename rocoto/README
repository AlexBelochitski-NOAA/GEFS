Run gefs workflow via ROCOTO

1) Check out a working copy of gefs based workflow from VLAB
   GIT repository is https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/redmine/projects/gefs/repository
   >cd /gpfs/hps3/emc/ensemble/save/First.Last/GEFS   # note that First.Last is your user name
   >mkdir tfAa; cd tfAa                               # tfAa is your test name, it can be any 4-letter string
   >ln -s your_local_directory/gefs nwdev
   >cd nwdev/sorc; ./build.sh ./install.sh
    Build all executable for running GEFS. Please read the README.build file.

2) Set up ROCOTO and python environment
   python (WCOSS-only):
   >module use -a /gpfs/hps3/emc/global/save/Terry.McGuinness/produtil/modulefiles (SURGE)
     or
   >module use -a /gpfs/hps3/emc/ensemble/noscrub/Xiaqiong.Zhou/modulefiles    (LUNA)
   >module load pyprodutil
   (python2 is already loaded by default on Theia)

   rocoto (WCOSS):
   >module use -a /gpfs/hps3/emc/hwrf/noscrub/soft/modulefiles
   >module load xt-lsfhpc/9.1.3
   >module load rocoto/1.2.3

   or a new version of rocoto:
   (NOTE: Bin Liu's message 20171205, per Sam's suggestion, you may also consider loading a new version of rocotoi)

   module use /gpfs/hps/usrx/local/emc_rocoto/modulefiles
   module load rocoto/1.2.4-RC3

   rocoto (Theia):
   >module load rocoto (default version is 1.2.4)

3) Generate ROCOTO xml and cronjob 
   a) >cd tfAa/nwdev/rocoto
      check the user.conf_protype file, get your own copy if necessary
   b) check the config.sh file and modify it based on your own choice of dates, sycle and various diretoriesFIRST and LAST names  
      >./config.sh  This will generate your own user_conf file.
      check the user_conf to make sure your choice of dates, sycle and various diretories are correctly specified  
      if necessary, you can  edit the file user.conf with working directory, workflow directory, dates, cycle  etc. of your experinment.

      (Theia only) On Theia, you *must* additionally edit user.conf to change the WHERE_AM_I and fix the directory paths:
        WHERE_AM_I=theia
        WORKDIR=/scratch4/NCEPDEV/stmp4/$USER/o
        GEFS_ROCOTO=/scratch4/NCEPDEV/ensemble/save/$USER/GEFS/xxxx/nwdev/rocoto
        SOURCEDIR=/scratch4/NCEPDEV/ensemble/save/$USER/GEFS
   c) >./run_gefs.py -w gefs.xml
       The rocoto xml file gefs.xml and conjob file cron_rocoto should be generated.
   d) >rocotorun -w gefs.xml -d gefs.db
       Queries the job scheduler and updates the rocoto SQL database, then submits any new jobs that are ready to run. This will start
          your job immediately.
   d) Add rocotorun to your crontab so it runs automatically:
        If you have nothing in your crontab, you can set cron_rocoto as your crontab directly:
          >crontab cron_rocoto
        This will overwrite your whole crontab, so if you already have other jobs in your cron, copy the last line in cron_rocoto into
          your cron using >crontab -e
   e) Check the status of running tasks.
        Use rocotoviewer (recommended):
          While there is a rocotoviewer in the GFS pacakage, it needs a modification for the GEFS workflow that hasn't been added to GFS yet.
          Use the following versions (it is recommended you set an alias to this to avoid typing is out all the time):
            WCOSS: /gpfs/hps3/emc/ensemble/save/Walter.Kolczynski/fv3gfs/gfs_workflow.v15.0.0/ush/rocoto_viewer.py
            Theia: /scratch4/NCEPDEV/ensemble/save/Walter.Kolczynski/rocoto_viewer.py

            Assuming an alias to rv:
            > rv -w gefs.xml -d gefs.db

            In rocotoviewer, you can execute many of the rocoto commands. You can get a list of commands using 'h', but the key ones are:
              up/down to change task
              left/right to change cycle
              <x> to expand metatasks
              <R> to run rocotorun
              <r> to run rocotorewind on the selected task(s), which deletes entries for this job from the SQL database (so it can be rerun)
              <c> to run rocotocheck on the selected task(s) (show status of a task)
              <Enter> to add a job to the selection (to select multiple jobs)
              Hold <Shift> while using arrows to select multiple sequential tasks

        or

        Use rocotostat:
          >rocotostat -w gefs.xml -d gefs.db

          This just dumps current job information to the screen in a somewhat ugly format, and it is non-interactive.

   f) Go to $WORKDIR (defined in user.conf) for checking job standard outputs and output files
      of your experiment.

4) If you need to modify the workflow, some simple actions can be taken:
   a) modify gefs.xml.in to avoid a group of jobs (YES or NO) or a specific job (delete a particular line)   
   b) modify tasks/cray/~.ent file to delete or change the dependemce requirements.
   c) the current setiing is to run the init-fcst-post-prdgen-ensstat-track/genesis-enspost for high resolution only.
