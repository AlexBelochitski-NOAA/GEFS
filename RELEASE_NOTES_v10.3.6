Release Note: GEFS LEGACY v.10.3.6

v10.0.0 . released Feb 1, 2012
. Implementation on CCS

v10.1.0 . released July 25, 2013
. Modified model to run on WCOSS

v10.2.0 . released Oct 16, 2014 (The first version in EE structure, but contains only part of the
package: GEFS_INIT jobs and GEFS_PRDGEN_GFS)
. Modified initialization to run downstream of GFS implementation

v10.2.1 . released Jan 1, 2015
. As implemented with GFS implementation Jan 14, 2015

v10.3.0 -- released August 12, 2015
. Legacy GEFS to continue uncalibrated GEFS v10 products for users who calibrate them using
the GEFS V10 reforecasts
. Minimal changes from current production, including the following:
. Remaining GEFS jobs have been converted to vertical structure
. Bug fixes that change the products slightly:
. Forecast model bug (that caused crashes in 201410 and 201506) is fixed
. Relocation code bugs discovered during V11 development are fixed
. /COM and /NWGES directories are renamed to gefs_legacy
. Version file is renamed to gefs_legacy.ver to avoid name collision with gefs.ver
. pgrb2c, pgrbd, and pgrb2d products and their DBN alerts are turned off
. CQPF job has been removed because it provides calibrated products
. forecasts for 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z are shortened to 6 hours
. all dbn alerts for these forecasts are turned off
. the only known downstream user of these forecasts is the wave ensemble
. ENSPOST and ENSSTAT jobs do not need to be run for these cycles
. error checking developed for V11 has been added to the INIT, POST, and
PRDGEN jobs
. resources and runtimes are unchanged except for the shortened 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z forecasts
. the RESTART_COPY job is optional; it only needs to be done if crashed forecasts need to be
rerun from the latest restart files instead of being rerun from the beginning
. To implement:
. check out into /nw$envir/gefs.v10.3.0
. in sorc subdirectory (to build and install codes in sorc, sorc.tracker, and util/sorc):
. sh build.sh
. sh install.sh
. copy the version file to the directory /nw$envir/versions
. There is a test run for comparison:
. source: /ensemble/save/Richard.Wobus/s/rwik/nwdev/gefs.v10.3.0
. products: /ptmpd2/emc.enspara/o/rwik/com/gens/dev
. To run identically to this test run, copy the sfcsig and track subdirectories from
one cycle and start running the next cycle.

. modify all DBN alerts to a standard model name for the GEFS Legacy system
. modify file location specifications to run under gefs_legacy.v10.3.* instead of gefs.v10.3.*
. To implement:
. check out into /nw$envir/gefs_legacy.v10.3.3
. remaining instructions are unchanged from gefs.v10.3.0
. There is a test run on gyre for comparison:
. source: /ensemble/save/Richard.Wobus/s/rwiu/nwdev/gefs_legacy.v10.3.3
. products: /ptmpd2/emc.enspara/o/rwiu/com/gens/dev
. To run identically to this test run, copy the sfcsig and track subdirectories from
one cycle and start running the next cycle.

v10.3.4 released December 21, 2015
. modify post cleanup job to save all 00Z sfcsig and sflux files
. mirror these files for downstream applications
. implementation instructions:
. use new tag: https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gefs/tags/gefs_legacy.v10.3.4
. check out into /nw$envir/gefs_legacy.v10.3.4
. add 00Z sfcsig and sflux files to the mirror to theia
